#Space Complexity
# While computing space complexity, you don't consider the input size, instead you consider the extra variables and lists etc that you are creating
# If you don't create any new list, the space complexity will be -- O(1) -- read it as -- ooh one
# If you declare an array that depends on input, The space complexity will be O(n)
# Any extra memory needed by an algorithm
