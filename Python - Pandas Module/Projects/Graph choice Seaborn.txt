The choice of graph in Seaborn depends on the type of data you have and the kind of relationship you want to visualize. Here are some general guidelines:

Use scatter plots for two continuous variables to see if they are correlated.

Use bar plots for a categorical and a continuous variable to see the distribution of the continuous variable per category.

Use histograms or dist plots to visualize the distribution of a single continuous variable.

Use box plots to compare the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories.

Use heatmaps for visualizing 2D arrays, like correlation matrices.

Remember, these are just guidelines. The best way to learn is by experimenting with different types of graphs and seeing which one provides the most insight into your data.
